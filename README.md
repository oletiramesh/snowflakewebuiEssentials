# snowflakewebuiEssentials
Recently I completed certification of  Snowflake WebUi Essentials Course.
I practiced interesting code during the course part to obtain insights on Semistructured data(using JSON files) of TWITTER DATA
By utilising computer power of Snowflake WEB UI.

Go through XML & JSON file formats in the folder notice headers
Try the DDL , DML commands given inside the folder.

You will need a trail account of snowflake to test the given files.
